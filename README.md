## Weathrly 

This is a port of my [old Weathrly project](https://github.com/gness1804/weathrly-react-native) bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). It contains all of the features of the original, plus a rebuilt design.

*Tested on:*
* Android: real Nexus 5X and Nexus 9 using the Expo app.
* iOS: iPhone6 simulator using the Expo XDE.
